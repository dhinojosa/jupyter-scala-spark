* Jupyter notebook help and introduction in the README.md

Scala
-----
* The references description is all over the place in where we describe any, anyref, and anyval
* Talk about collections before
* implicits surely needed
* Tell people about == is equals
* I didn't cover Vector (Done)
* What about for comprehensions?
* Stream?
* Parameterized Type (Done)
* Option and functions
* Partial Function 
* Ensure we have options in all examples for functions
* Ensure we have example for each one
* Prime also has a square root
* FoldLeft or Reduce
* Always look in the object for ways to create collections

Spark

Implicits
Where do I first say that `DataSet` and `DataFrame` are the same
How to run it
collect
collect_list
expand rows
order_by
write a dataframe using dataframe.write
partition
need encoding and writing back to the file system
update run.bat
:_*
How to load a job
How Partitions work
